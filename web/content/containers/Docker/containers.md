A _container_ is the actual running instance of an application that has been packaged from an image. It includes all the specified files, libraries, and settings from the image it was based upon, and also provides additional elements like an operating system, CPU allocation, memory, and other resources to enable the application's execution. Containers run inside a host operating system but are isolated from it, sharing the kernel and resources while having their own file system and network interface.
