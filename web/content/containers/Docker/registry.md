Once we build an image, we want to share this image so we can then either share with other stakeholders, developers or customers. To accomplish this, images can be uploaded to a registry. Registers are similar to program language package managers, allowing consumers to download specific images that may be needed to develop other images

While there are other third-party registeries that you can upload to (AWS ECR, Google )
