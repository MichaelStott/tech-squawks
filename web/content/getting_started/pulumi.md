When working in cloud environments, it is useful to have a tool which defines and statefully manages our infrastructure, 
specifically resources to facilitate creating, updating, and deleting new objects. Pulumi is such a tool that allows us to
do this programtically in these tutorials.

## Setup

1. Download and install Pulumi following the instructions [here](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/).

2. Confirm the CLI is successfully installed by running the following.

```sh
pulumi version
```

3. If the above executes successfully, test creating a project on your machine. Select one of the following options based on your programming language(s) of choice.

```sh
pulumi new
```
