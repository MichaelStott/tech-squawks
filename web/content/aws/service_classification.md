AWS makes certain resources available through _services_, either via the API or the AWS 
console.

Regions offerings and pricing can differ between various regions. New service offergings tend
to be rolled out to us-east-1 initially. Because of this, us-east-1 also tends to be the most
volatile of AWS regions.

An overview of AWS service classifications is provided below. You can also explore the full service
