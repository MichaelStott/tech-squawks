### Cloud Computing Services

For on-premise applications, organizations or individuals manage all the underlying compute, storage, and 
networking infrastructure for their systems and services.

Depending on the type of service offering, cloud computing manages some or all of these components. There 
are three cloud computing models, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) Platform as a Service (PaaS), 
and Software as a Service (SaaS).

#### Infrastructure as a Service - IaaS

IaaS manages the underlying network and hardware infrastructure, while providing control of the host OS and application/software to the user. Any cloud provider that provides access to virtualized or phsyical servers would be example of this, such as the AWS EC2 service.

#### Platform as a Service - PaaS

PaaS manages everything IaaS manages in addition to the environment OS and runtime, allowing users to primarily focus on developing their applicaiton. An example of PaaS would be Heroku, which allows developers to upload their applications to a server without having to worry about provisioning the underlying hardware or OS. The AWS 
offers a similar service known as Elastic Beanstalk.

#### Software as a Service - SaaS

For SaaS products, the user manages none of the underlying instrastructure or application logic and simply and consumes the end result of an application. An example of this would be Dropbox or the AWS S3 service, where 
users can upload data through a web console or API while AWS maintains all backend services.
