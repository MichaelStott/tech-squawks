### Cloud Computing Services

There are three types of cloud computing models:
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Manages the underlying network and hardware infrastructure, while providing control of the host OS and application/software to the user. Any cloud provider that provides access to virtualized or phsyical servers would be example of this, such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.
- Platform as a Service (PaaS): Manages the underlying network infrastructure and host OS, while providing the user control software/application. An example of PaaS would be Heroku, which allows developers to upload their applications to a server without having to worry about provisioning the underlying hardware or OS.
- Software as a Service (SaaS): Only the hosted software is available to the user.released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. An example of SaaS would be Dropbox, as it provides users and developers with file storage functionality through a web page and API.
