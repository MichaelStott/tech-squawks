### What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is essentially the ability to provision and manage network resources, such as servers or data stores,  through a web interface, such as a web page or API. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) define it as such:

> Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

Cloud computing resources can be provisioned on-demand and typically utilize a pay-as-you-go model. It alleviates the need for businesses to invest in and manage private data centers.
