### Definition

*Cloud computing* is essentially the ability to provision and manage computational and network resources, such as servers, networks, or data stores, through a web interface, such as a web page or API.  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) formally [define](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-145/final) cloud computing as follows:

> Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

Companies and third-parties with cloud computing platform offerings are known as *cloud providers*. Popular cloud providers are Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

### Benefits and Drawbacks

Cloud computing affords engineers numerous benefits when developing applications, such as:
- Rapid, on-demand provisioning of cloud resources (servers, data stores, etc.)
- Cost-effective computing and storage.
- Easily scale infrastructure up or down based on service load. 

### Classifications

Various cloud service offerings provide customers trade-offs between configurability, costs, and administrative overhead, ranging from fully user-configurable virtual environments to completely managed services, such as databases. 

### Cloud Native

The rise of cloud computing has accelerated the adoption of practices for developing robust cloud applications, collectively known as cloud-native development. These practices include microservices, containerization, and serverless development. 

### AWS

These tutorials will target AWS for deploying examples and exploring cloud computing design. AWS is one the earliest and, at the time of writing, most popular cloud provider. While  the individual implementation of computing, data-store, networking, and other cloud services varies between cloud-providers, the principles learned here can be applied to all platforms.
