title: Benefits & Considerations

An increasing number of organizations are leveraging cloud computing or considering migrating existing applications to the cloud. Because of this, it is important for developers to evaluate the common benefits and additional considerations of working in such environments. 

### Benefits

#### On-Demand 

In traditional on-premise environments, if engineers required new infrastructure, a considerable amount of time was required  to install and configure the hardware in an organization's data center. Alternatively, cloud resources can typically be provisioned within a few seconds to a few minutes. This on-demand provisioning of resources enables more rapid experimentation and application development. 

#### Economical 

Cloud computing can potentially be more economical than traditional on-premise environments. Cloud resources can be provisioned usually with no up-front cost, such as purchasing hardwares, utilizing a pay-as-you-go model. All hardware management is offloaded from organizations to the cloud provider. Additionally, because cloud providers purchase hardware in bulk, they are able to leverage economies of scale and pass those savings onto cloud customers.

Readers should note that these benefits are broad generalities and should always take into account the specifics of their organization when performing a cost-benefit analysis. For instance, Dropbox initially developed their platform using cloud technologies, notably AWS S3, before later [migrating to their own infrastructure](https://www.geekwire.com/2018/dropbox-saved-almost-75-million-two-years-building-tech-infrastructure), which increased their performance and costs.

#### Scalability 

Whereas traditional on-prem applications may be limited by the machines limited to an organization's data center, cloud services can be easily scaled in the cloud to account for an increase in load. A common example would be organizations provisioning more servers or compute capacity on Black Friday to handle holiday traffic.  Conversely, resources can be scaled down to save on costs. 

There are two types of scaling, horizontal and vertical. Horizontal scaling refers to adding additional nodes/services/concurrent processes to your application to handle an increase in load. Vertical scaling refers to increasing CPU, memory, or storage of your application.
