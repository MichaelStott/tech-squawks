### Deployment Models

There are three cloud computing deployment models:
- All-in-cloud: The entirety of the application is hosted using a cloud service provider (AWS)
- Hybrid: Some applications are hosted in the cloud and communicate with on-premise infrastructure.
- On-premise (private) cloud: Resources are deployed in a private data center using virtualization or resource management tools.
