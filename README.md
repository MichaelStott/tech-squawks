## About

The aim of this website is to present cloud-computing concepts using small, self-contained web apps. To achieve this, 
cloud infrastructure and services are managed with Pulumi. Pulumi allows users to easily define their cloud resources 
using programming languages such as Typescript, Javascript, Python, Go, and Java 

Flashcards are included at the end of each section to help reinforce concepts covered in the section.

These tutorials are very much a work-in-progress. As a result, the site structure and URLs may be subject to change.

## Development

### Website

To launch the website locally, you will need to install `hugo`:

```
$ cd web
$ hugo server
```

To build the website with drafts included, run `hugo server -D`

To sync any code examples referenced in the `code` directory run `npm run sync`

### Code Examples

All code examples can be found under the `code` directory. All should be 
deployable via:

```
$ pulumi up
```

The CI/CD pipeline should automatically detect new or modified projects and
ensure that `pulumi preview` runs successfully.

## Deployment

```
$ pulumi stack select dev
$ pulumi up
```
